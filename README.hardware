4. BSP Notes
============

4.1 NXP LS1028a-rdb
-------------------

4.1.1 Validated Board Info
--------------------------

This BSP is only validated in following environment. If you use this BSP
in a different environment it may possibly have some issues.

	Processor:		LS1028AE Rev1.0 (0x870b0010)

4.2 USB 3.0 ref clk errors from dmesg
-------------------------------------

From May 2018, dwc3 did a mainline commit(fe8abf33) to support clocks and resets
for DWC3 core, and it seems ls1028a didn't follow it. Given this, when the board boot,
the following error will show:
	dwc3 3100000.usb: Failed to get clk 'ref': -2
	dwc3 3110000.usb: Failed to get clk 'ref': -2
There is no obvious harm to USB usage so far, and this will be fixed later.

4.3 M.2 Sata interface disabled by default
------------------------------------------

According to the section 2.10 M.2 connectors in QorIQ LS1028A Reference Design
Board Reference Manual(Revision C), the M.2 Key E connector (J18) and this M.2
Key B connector (J20, Sata interface) multiplex the LYNX36 SerDes lane 3. They
can not be enabled at the same time, and the M.2 J18 connector is the default
one from hardware level. So this is why SATA is not validated. Please refer to
the vendor for more information.
